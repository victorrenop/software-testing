## Random Program Description

Build a class to classify the damage dealt by a RPG character. The damage scales in 3 different steps and depends on the type of damage.

Physical damage is affected by the 3 steps of damage and the resulting damage is cumulative.

Magical damage is only affected by the first and last steps of damage, due to being too overpowered.

The three steps of damage are:
- 24.5% of the current damage is added to the total
- 40% of the current damage is added to the total
- 15% of the current damage is added to the total
