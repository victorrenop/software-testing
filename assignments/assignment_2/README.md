# Assignment 1

Develop any small functionality using TDD.

## Chosen Functionality

Count the occurrence of each word on a text file and return the result on a list, ordered by highest frequency to lowest frequency and, if a tie occurs, sort alphabetically. With another function, count the occurrence of all words in all text files read so far and return with the same rule as the first.
The text contains commas, dots, new lines and blank spaces, which should not be considered.

# Usage

Run on project root folder:
```
$ pytest tests/unit/assignments/assignment_2/
```
